/**
 * Unreflect is small but very powerful alternative to java reflection API. Provides easy to use type, class, field,
 * method and constructor lookup and access. Enables high-performance reflection by using code generation. Bypasses all
 * JVM security checks to enable access to any modules and members for both reflection based and bytecode generated API.
 * Reflection API is accessible by {@link Unreflect#reflect(Class)}.
 * Code-generated API is accessible by {@link Unreflect#unreflect(Class)}.
 * Library utilizes JDK's internal API and is not guaranteed to work with different versions of JDK, this library should
 * not be used in production.
